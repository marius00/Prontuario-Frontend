# Protocolo Digital

Missing:
* Reject document (not just accept)
* Undo accept document
* Notifications
* Real login / api
* localstorage with delayed sync
* Edit an existing registration [only by creator]
* Hamburger on search should also have edit if you made it, since it won't be on dashboard after a while
* dashboard should only show recents
** When adding a new user/sector, if the user already exists, re-use the password
** There is no hover effect on buttons, so it feels very broken
* "require password reset on next login" when creating user.. needs backend + frontend support.
* Need to go over the repo, lots of minor mistakes made, vars not existing etc.
* observations & pacient name should swap, location and size.
* "select all"
